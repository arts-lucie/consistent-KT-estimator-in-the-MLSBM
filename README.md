The file code_ML-DynSBM.R contains all the functions used for the simulations. 
Each other file corresponds to a specific experiment conducted as part of the project.


accuracy.R : Experiment comparing the accuracy of different methods.
computation_time.R : Experiment observing the computation time.
rate_CV_edges.R : Experiment attempting to observe the rate of convergence in the case where the maximum number of interactions is constant.
rate_CV_nodes.R : Experiment attempting to observe the rate of convergence in the case where the number of nodes is constant.
sparse.R : Experiment in a sparse regime context.
